# Technical Implementation: Client‑Side Coin Flip Web App

## Overview
A minimal, client‑side only web application that flips a virtual coin and displays the result (Heads/Tails). It uses secure randomness when available, provides a simple animation, and includes basic accessibility and reduced‑motion support. No backend is required; the app is a static site that can be opened directly in a browser.

## Goals
- Client‑side only implementation
- Deterministic UI behavior with secure randomness when possible
- Simple, understandable code and structure
- Accessibility essentials and reduced‑motion support
- Zero build tooling; just open index.html

## Non‑Goals
- No server or persistence
- No external dependencies or frameworks
- No analytics or telemetry

## Tech Stack
- HTML5 for structure
- CSS3 for layout and animation
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+) for logic
