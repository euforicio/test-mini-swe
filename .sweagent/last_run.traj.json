Analyze the codebase by finding and reading relevant files\n2. Create a script to reproduce the issue\n3. Edit the source code to resolve the issue\n4. Verify your fix works by running your script again\n5. Test edge cases to ensure your fix is robust\n6. Submit your changes and finish your work by issuing the following command: `echo COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT`.\n   Do not combine it with any other command. <important>After this command, you cannot continue working on this task.</important>\n\n## Important Rules\n\n1. Every response must contain exactly one action\n2. The action must be enclosed in triple backticks\n3. Directory or environment variable changes are not persistent. Every action is executed in a new subshell.\n   However, you can prefix any action with `MY_ENV_VAR=MY_VALUE cd /path/to/working/dir && ...` or write/load environment variables from files\n\n<system_information>\nLinux 6.12.9-200.fc41.aarch64 #1 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Thu Jan  9 16:37:16 UTC 2025 aarch64 \n</system_information>\n\n## Formatting your response\n\nHere is an example of a correct response:\n\n<example_response>\nTHOUGHT: I need to understand the structure of the repository first.
