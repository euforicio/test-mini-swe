## Random Number 1â€“10

A tiny static page that displays a random integer from 1 to 10 and lets you generate a new one.

How to run locally:
- Open index.html in your browser (no build, no dependencies).

How it works:
- A small app.js uses Math.floor(Math.random() * 10) + 1 to produce integers in [1,10].
